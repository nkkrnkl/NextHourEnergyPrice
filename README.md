# NextHourEnergyPrice

## Hourly energy demand generation and weather

In this notebook I analyzed with Python two data sets, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather: 
1) energy_dataset.csv ->  hourly energy production (MWh) in Spain from different sources such as oil, wind energy, fossil fuels etc. The total production on the Spanish grid and the price of energy are, also, included.
2) weather_features.csv -> hourly weather conditions such as temperature, rain, humidity etc. in five different cities in Spain (Madrid, Barcelona, Valecia, Seville, and Bilbao)

## Goal
My aim was to explore the energy market in Spain and try to predict the next hour's electricity price, using two ML algorithms (Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Regression).
